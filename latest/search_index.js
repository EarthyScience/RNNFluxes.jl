    "text": "Here is a quick demonstration of how to train and apply an LSTM. Lets create some artificial input data first:nTime=100\nnSample=200\nnVarX = 3\nx = [rand(nVarX,nTime) for i=1:nSample]\n\ntrue_model(x) = transpose(cumsum(x[1,:])+exp.(x[2,:])+cumprod(1.7*x[3,:]))\n\ny = true_model.(x);Let's see what we have here. x contains the predictor variables. It is contains 200 samples of multivariate time series. Each sample is a nVar x nTime matrix containing the inputs for the model. Our function true_model generates a new time series from such a multivariate time series and is applied to every input sample. So our target variable y contains nSample row Vectors of length ntime.Now we create a model:using RNNFluxes\nnHid=15\nm=RNNFluxes.LSTMModel(nVarX,nHid,nDropout=1)This initializes an LSTM model containing 15 hidden nodes which represent the persistent state of the model. To train the model we can run:train_net(m,x,y,5001);This trains the model m for 5001 update steps. Note that the model variable m is updated in-place. To test how well our model performs, we generate a test dataset:xtest = [rand(nVarX,nTime)]\nytest = true_model.(xtest)[1]and do a prediction using our trained model mypred = predict_after_train(m,xtest)[1]Now we can compare the true vs predicted results:using Plots\ngr()\nplot(ytest',ypred)"

RNNFluxes.GenericModelA short example on how to define and train such a generic model follows. Let's assume we already know the model structure but want to estimate the parameters.

    "text": "For training a model well, it is essential to provide a suitable loss function, which in many cases is more complicated than a simple MSE. To give some inspiration, here are a few examples of loss functions and derivatives that we have used in our work. The function signature of the loss function should be: (w::Vector, x::Vector{Matrix},y::Vector{Matrix},model::FluxModel)->Number, where w is the weight vector, x the predictors, y the true targets and model is the model applied. The function returns a single number. The derivative is defined by overloading the RNNFluxes.deriv function with a new method depending on the loss function type. The signature is (t::Type{Function},ytrue,ypred,i)->Number where t is the type of the loss function, ytrue is a time series of observations, ypred a predicted time series and i the index for which the derivative is calculated."
